    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating 
        field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe
       for iron , H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>
        Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i><br>
        2H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>->2H<sub>2</sub>O <br>
        This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><i>Stoichiometry</i> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical 
    requations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
